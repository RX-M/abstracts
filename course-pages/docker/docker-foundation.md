<!-- Docker Foundation -->

This intensive three-day hands-on Docker training course is designed to provide working developers, DevOps staff and other technology professionals with a comprehensive introduction to Docker. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of the architectural constructs in the Linux kernel enabling Docker; how containers are used in development, test and production settings; Docker OSS & commercial products and their place in the market; as well as how other players in the container ecosystem fit into various Docker solution stacks.

During the course, students will gain hands-on experience with the Docker command line, Dockerfiles and Docker image architecture. The course covers Container operations in depth and exposes attendees to the full range of Docker subcommands and Dockerfile instructions in their entirety so that, upon completion of the course, attendees will have the skills and information necessary to begin integrating container technology with their development, test and deployment processes. The course wraps with an introduction to advanced topics such as Docker volume, security, networking, and clustering, providing a natural transition when combined with RX-M's advanced Docker training course.
