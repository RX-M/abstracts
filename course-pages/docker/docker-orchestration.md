<!-- Docker Orchestration with Compose and Swarm -->

This intensive two-day hands-on training course is designed to provide technology staff with a jump start with Docker Compose, along with an intensive introduction to container orchestration with Docker Swarm.

The course takes a comprehensive look at Docker Compose and container configuration possibilities made available by Compose. Students are introduced to Compose and its purpose; will be exposed to the entire Compose DSL; will have the chance to install Compose and define and build basic Compose applications.

The course reviews Docker Swarm architecture including nodes and node configurations. Students are introduced to the Raft and Gossip protocols and various docker commands for working with clusters. The new Distributed Application Bundle (DAB) image format is covered along with stacks, services, tasks, nodes, and other Docker Swarm primitives. Docker services are covered in-depth, including replicated and global service operation, scaling features, tasks, task states, the Docker service routing mesh, services discovery, and failover.
