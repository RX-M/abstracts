<!-- CI with Jenkins -->

RX-M's Jenkins course can be delivered in 1, 2 or 3 days depending on whether students require introductory, intermediate or in-depth knowledge of Jenkins and its function in a continuous integration environment. Each day provides discussion and labs giving students practical experience with Jenkins and its integration points.

Introductory topics include an overview of CI, Agile and TDD concepts; Jenkins operations and configuration; and integration with build systems such as Ant, Make and Rake.

Intermediate training covers common Jenkins tools, plugins, and skills required to deploy and operate Jenkins in a production environment, including access control, distributed build architecture and installing and configuring plugins.

Advanced topics covered are common Jenkins integration points and skills needed to maximize the function of Jenkins in a modern enterprise, including using Jenkins with Docker, building automation chains and writing plugins.

Using this platform students will learn and create a variety of Jenkins Jobs working with a wide range of plugins and Jenkins features which will give them confidence to continue using Jenkins in their own environments and workflows.
