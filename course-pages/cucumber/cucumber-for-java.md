<!-- Cucumber for Java -->

This course is designed to give practicing Java programmers and testers a comprehensive introduction to the features of Cucumber in a Java environment. Attendees will learn BDD concepts and how Cucumber facilitates such development practices, combining Domain Driven Design with Test Driven Development. Training covers general Cucumber philosophy and features but tailors practical examples and labs to the Java development environment.

JRuby and Cuke4Duke are used to allow participants to develop Cucumber tests in Java for Java. Participants will become familiar with crafting executable specifications in the form of Cucumber features and step-driven tests. Hands-on labs take students through the process of building requirement-driven test suites for new and existing Java applications using a range of features including data tables and databases. Labs also give participants practical experience installing and configuring Cucumber for Java.
