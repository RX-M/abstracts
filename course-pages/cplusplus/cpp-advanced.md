<!-- C++ Advanced -->

This intensive hands on course takes developers through some of the key advanced features in C++ software development.
The course makes use of C++11 but introduces features from C++14 and C++17 with clear attribution. The course modules
provide coverage of important advanced features of modern C++. Attendees will learn how to create function and class
templates, how to make use of advanced features of the C++ standard library, how to design more effective/correct
programs and more. The course is organized into modules, each with hands on coding labs designed to reinforce the module
content and give attendees practical coding experience. Upon completion, attendees will have the knowledge and
experience necessary to begin writing sophisticated software in C++.
