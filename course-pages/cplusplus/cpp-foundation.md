<!-- C++ Foundation -->

This intensive hands-on course takes developers from first principals through to practical program construction in C++. The course makes use of C++11 but introduces features from C++14 and C++17 with clear attribution. The course modules provide coverage of the most important and foundational features of the C++ programming language. Attendees will learn how to create and build programs, how to properly construct classes, manage memory, how to run and debug programs, how to work with exceptions, streams, threads and more. The course is organized into 12 modules each with hands-on coding labs designed to reinforce the module content and give attendees practical coding experience. Upon completion, attendees will have the knowledge and experience necessary to begin writing real applications in C++.
