<!-- ELK Stack -->

This two-day hands-on training course is designed to give attendees an introductory understanding of the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) as it relates to analysis and aggregation with a specific focus on Kibana. Together, these three different open source products are most commonly used in log analysis, web analytics, security, and business intelligence. Upon completion students will have manually installed and configured an ELK system as well as gained direct experience in manipulating the Kibana interface.

In this course, participants will learn how to install, configure, and operationalize the ELK stack with a specific focus on learning Kibana. The ELK Stack is a collection of three open-source products — Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana — from Elastic. Elasticsearch is a NoSQL database that is based on the Lucene search engine. Logstash is a log pipeline tool that accepts inputs from various sources, executes different transformations, and exports the data to various targets. Kibana is a visualization layer that works on top of Elasticsearch.
