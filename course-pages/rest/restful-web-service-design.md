<!-- RESTful Web Service Design -->

This course provides a detailed look at RESTful service design and best practices in a language-agnostic setting. Attendees will gain a deep appreciation for the ability of properly designed RESTful services to leverage the infrastructure of the Web. Each of the six REST constraints will be examined in detail along with the HTTP features which empower these constraints over the Internet. Important design concepts including resource-based modeling, the Richardson Maturity Model and decoupling clients and servers through HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) are covered in depth.

RPC and resource-based client-server interaction styles are contrasted in the context of a range of related technologies, including REST, SOAP, Protocol Buffers, and Apache Thrift. Interface examples from Twitter, Amazon and several others will be used to illustrate design practices and pitfalls. Upon course completion, attendees should have a solid understanding of the guiding principles of REST and how to apply these principles to practical interface design.


### Delivery

Available for Instructor-Led (ILT) in-person/onsite training or Virtual Instructor-Led training (VILT) delivery; Open Enrollment options may be available.


### Who Should Attend?

Developers, Architects and Technical Managers


### What Attendees will learn

This course is designed to provide engineering staff with a comprehensive look at RESTful service architecture and
design. Learning modules include:

- REST Architecture
- Uniform Interface, Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)
- Empowering scalable architecture
- Resource oriented architectures
- RESTful service design principles


### Prerequisites

Each attendee will require the ability to run a 64 bit virtual machine (provided with the course). Basic Linux command
line skills are valuable but not required.
