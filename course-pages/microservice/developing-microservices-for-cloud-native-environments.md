<!-- Deploying Microservices for Cloud Native Environments -->

This intensive three-day hands-on course is designed to provide working developers, DevOps staff and other technology professionals with a comprehensive introduction to microservices and cloud native microservice environments. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of microservices and how to maximize them in the cloud. 

Modern tooling and processes are examined, including various agile methodologies, gitops and a range of CI/CD tools. The course also covers migration from monolithic solutions and strategies for brownfield cloud native development. Upon completion of the course, attendees will have the skills and information necessary to begin designing and developing effective microservice-based applications for Kubernetes and other cloud native environments.


### Delivery

Available for Instructor-Led (ILT) in-person/onsite training or Virtual Instructor-Led training (VILT) delivery; Open Enrollment options may be available.


### Who Should Attend?

Developers, Architects, Release Engineers (RE), Engineering Managers and DevOps personnel


### What Attendees will learn
