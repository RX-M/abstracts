<!-- Deploying and Instrumenting Microservices on Kubernetes -->

This two-day intensive hands-on course is designed to provide software engineers with a deeper look at the Go programming language and its idioms. This course delves into the conceptual and practical aspects of coding in Go. Engineers will learn the hows and whys to coding naturally in Go. The course deals with the most important advanced features of Go programing and discusses best practices throughout, including many external references. Day one begins with Go idioms and common Go programming constructs, followed by coverage of testing and test tools and advanced function and method usage. The problem fraught area of package management is dealt with as well, including a variety of industry references and best practices. The communicating sequential processes model, goroutines, channels, and concurrency are explored at the start of day two, followed by a look at reflection and C integration with Go. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of the more advanced features of the Go programming language and the necessary preparation to begin developing production Go applications.


### Delivery

Available for Instructor-Led (ILT) in-person/onsite training or Virtual Instructor-Led training (VILT) delivery; Open Enrollment options may be available.


### Who Should Attend?

Developers, Architects, Release Engineers (RE), Engineering Managers and DevOps personnel


### What Attendees will learn

This course is designed to provide developers, devops and other engineering staff with an in depth look at the key practical considerations associated with microservice deployment on Kubernetes. Learning modules include:

- Microservice orchestration
- Kubernetes services and networking
- Stateless services and polyglot persistence
- Operability and observability
- Gateways and service meshes


### Prerequisites

Because the course focuses on microservice design and development, no particular programming language expertise is required though attendees should have experience with at least one programming language. Lab exercises are completed in Go (golang), experience with Go is beneficial but not required. A laptop and good internet access are also required.
