<!-- Deploying Microservices for Cloud Native Environments -->

This intensive three-day hands-on course is designed to provide working developers, DevOps staff and other technology professionals with a comprehensive introduction to microservices and cloud native microservice environments. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of microservices and how to maximize them in the cloud. Students will gain hands-on experience working with microservices in a range of labs covering microservice design, API construction, and state management. The course covers the benefits of container-based microservice packaging and the use of various Registry services. Attendees will examine several use cases and architecture patterns for microservice-based applications throughout the course, with focused discussion on microservice communications, event sourcing and transaction patterns such as choreography and orchestration. Modern tooling and processes are examined, including various agile methodologies, gitops and a range of CI/CD tools. The course also covers migration from monolithic solutions and strategies for brownfield cloud native development. Upon completion of the course, attendees will have the skills and information necessary to begin designing and developing effective microservice-based applications for Kubernetes and other cloud native environments.


### Delivery

Available for Instructor-Led (ILT) in-person/onsite training or Virtual Instructor-Led training (VILT) delivery; Open Enrollment options may be available.


### Who Should Attend?

Developers, Architects, Release Engineers (RE), Engineering Managers and DevOps personnel


### What Attendees will learn

This course is designed to provide engineering staff with a comprehensive overview of the microservices architecture style and the practical tools and techniques required for constructing effective cloud native applications. Learning modules include:

- Microservice overview: microservice application architecture, benefits, and challenges
- Software delivery pipelines
- Microservice communications: representational state transfer (REST), remote procedure call (RPC), and messaging
- Container packaging and registries
- Application evolution and state
- Cloud native transactions


### Prerequisites

Because the course focuses on microservice design and development, no particular programming language expertise is required though attendees should have experience with at least one programming language. A laptop and good internet access are required.
