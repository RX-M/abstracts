<!-- Advanced Kubernetes for Operators -->

This four day hands-on course is designed to provide experienced Kubernetes users with a deeper look at the Kubernetes
platform. The course picks up where Kubernetes Foundation leaves off and provides attendees with a detailed look at
the administration and deployment of the Kubernetes platform through a combination of lecture, demonstrations and
extensive lab work.

This course covers core Kubernetes control plane components, including: the API server, Scheduler, and Controller
Manager, as well as the worker node agents: Kubelet and Kube-Proxy. Students will gain hands-on experience configuring
and managing Kubernetes features and functions in a live Kubernetes lab cluster that they build by hand over a series of
labs. Those attending will leave with a clear understanding of the more advanced features and configurations of the
Kubernetes platform and how these features operate in a container-based enterprise.
