<!-- Kubernetes Foundation -->

RX-M’s foundational Kubernetes training covers all of the core features of Kubernetes orchestration and is the recommended prerequisite course for the rest of our Kubernetes curriculum. This intensive intro takes attendees from the installation of Kubernetes to Pod deployment and management using Controllers, Services, and mapped Volumes.

This Kubernetes training course is designed to provide technical staff with a comprehensive foundation to Kubernetes. All of the core features of Kubernetes orchestration are covered including, Pods, Labels, Volumes, Controllers, Services and more. The course takes attendees from installation to Pod deployment and management through a combination of lecture, demo and hands-on lab exercises where students will gain experience configuring and managing Kubernetes Pods, Deployments, Replica Sets, and Services. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of Kubernetes, how it operates in a container-based enterprise and will have learned the skills and knowledge necessary to begin using Kubernetes.
