<!-- Kubernetes Stateful Workloads -->

This two-day hands-on course is designed to provide technical staff with a practical look at best practices for storage and stateful service management on Kubernetes.

This course provides an in-depth and practical look at storage and stateful service management on Kubernetes. The course picks up where Kubernetes Foundation leaves off, digging deeper into configuration resources, persistent volumes, StatefulSets and local volume management. Attendees will learn best practices for state and configuration management on Kubernetes, including proper use of ConfigMaps, Secrets and encryption. The course also covers standard techniques for scheduling stateful workloads, ensuring failure domain diversity and working with local and remote volumes. Upon completion attendees with have the tools and experience necessary to begin designing and managing stateful services on Kubernetes.
