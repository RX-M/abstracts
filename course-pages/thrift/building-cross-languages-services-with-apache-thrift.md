<!-- Building Cross Languages Services with Apache Thrift -->

This training course provides a comprehensive introduction to the Apache Thrift cross-language serialization and RPC framework. Attendees will learn how to design robust and extensible services using the flexible Thrift IDL. Type and service design are covered in detail along with the implementation details necessary to bring interfaces to life. Attendees will learn how to use the Thrift IDL compiler to rapidly generate applications in a range of languages.

Prebuilt Apache Thrift RPC servers are described in detail along with Thrift client objects in both synchronous and asynchronous forms. Attendees will learn how to extend Thrift through custom layered and endpoint transports as well as proprietary protocols and servers. Common pitfalls and design best practices are covered in depth. Lab sessions make use of the clientâ€™s preferred language suite, ensuring that students walk away from this course with pragmatic cross-language examples and hands-on experience with their actual application development languages.


### Delivery

Available for Instructor-Led (ILT) in-person/onsite training or Virtual Instructor-Led training (VILT) delivery; Open Enrollment options may be available.


### Who Should Attend?

Developers, Architects, Engineering Managers and DevOps personnel


### What Attendees will learn

This course provides hands on experience with the latest release of Apache Thrift and any four supported languages selected by the client. Either C++ or Java should be included, preferably both, as these are the reference languages.

- Apache Thrift RPC including architecture, creating RPC services, creating servers and clients
- Apache Thrift Serialization including Thrift protocols and messaging systems
- Language Walk Through (client can select their desired languages)


### Prerequisites

Participants should have a working knowledge of the languages selected as the course will focus on using Apache Thrift rather than the languages themselves.
