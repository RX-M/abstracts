This course delves into the conceptual and practical aspects of coding in Go. In this intensive two-day hands-on course, engineers will learn the how's and why's to coding naturally in Go.

The course deals with the most important features of Go programming and discusses best practices throughout, including many external references. Day one begins with Go programming basics and gets developers up and running, covering topics such as program construction, basic syntax, data design and, functions. Interfaces and abstraction are explored at the start of day two, followed by the communicating sequential processes model and discussion around proper concurrency design and the use of Goroutines and channels.

Day two continues with an examination of effective package design and the use of the Go Tool and summary discussion around best practices. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of the Go language and the necessary preparation to begin developing programs in Go.
