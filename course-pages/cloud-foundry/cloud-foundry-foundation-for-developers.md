<!-- Cloud Foundry Foundation for Developers -->

This three-day hands-on course is designed to provide developers with a comprehensive introduction to the Cloud Foundry PaaS along with the processes and principles associated with building cloud native applications. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of the Cloud Foundry development toolchain and hands-on experience creating, deploying and managing applications. Each day is organized into four modules including a hands-on lab designed to give attendees practical experience with the key topics covered in the lecture. The course covers the benefits of microservices and the use of typical Cloud Foundry application development and management tools. Attendees will examine various use cases and architecture patterns for microservice-based applications throughout the course, with discussion on microservice communications, transactions, state, log, and metric management. Upon completion of the course, attendees will have the skills and information necessary to begin designing and working with microservice-based applications in the Cloud Foundry application runtime environment.

### What Attendees will learn

This course is designed to provide engineers with a foundational understanding of Cloud Foundry and experience deploying
and managing applications on the Cloud Foundry Application Runtime.

- Cloud Foundry overview
- Cloud Foundry Application Runtime (CFAR) in practice
- Building microservices on CFAR


### Prerequisites
