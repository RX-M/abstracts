<!-- Ansible -->

This hands-on foundational Ansible training course is designed to give IT, DevOps and other technology professionals a comprehensive introduction to the Ansible IT automation engine. Through lecture and intensive lab work, attendees will gain a clear understanding of Ansible's capabilities for provisioning, configuration management, deployment, and orchestration. The discussion will include the infrastructure-as-code (IaC) methodology and how Ansible accomplishes state enforcement with simple, easy to remember declaration syntax.

Students will experience using Ansible to complete configuration management tasks on server infrastructure and networking devices. Labs will guide attendees through a range of topics from learning basic Ansible ad-hoc commands to creating role-based playbooks that use the Jinja2 templating engine and syntax to ensure maximum flexibility and reusability of playbooks and supporting code.

Upon completion of the course, attendees will have a clear understanding of Ansible concepts and constructs, network automation using Ansible, IaC methodology & techniques, Ansible best practices, and will be prepared to start using Ansible to efficiently manage infrastructure at their organization.
