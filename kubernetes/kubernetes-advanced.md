## Advanced Kubernetes

This advanced Kubernetes training course picks up where RX-M's Kubernetes Foundation leaves off and is designed to provide experienced Kubernetes users with a detailed look at the administration and deployment of the Kubernetes platform through a combination of lecture, demonstrations and hands-on lab exercises. This course will give attendees a better understanding of Kubernetes features including the scheduler, replication controller master, kublet and service proxies.

Attendees will also get a chance to work with Kubernetes add-ons including DNS, container registry, web UIs and cluster monitoring. Students will gain hands-on experience configuring and managing Kubernetes features and functions in a live Kubernetes lab cluster and will also have a chance to work with Kubernetes in the cloud. Those attending will leave with a clear understanding of the more advanced features of Kubernetes and how they operate in a container-based enterprise.

This is an instructor-led training (ILT) class and is available for in-person and virtual delivery.
