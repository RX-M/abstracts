##Developing Kubernetes Operators

This intensive three day hands-on course is designed to provide SREs and software engineers with a comprehensive
introduction to the architecture, APIs and development practices involved in constructing Kubernetes operators.
Topics covered include operator basics, API and security facets relevant to operators, custom resource definitions (CRD), api aggregation and controllers. Each module is followed by a hands on lab where attendees build working software components that extend Kubernetes. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of the Kubernetes operator pattern and how to build native and framework based operator solutions.

This is an instructor-led training (ILT) class and is available for onsite and online delivery.
