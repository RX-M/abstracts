## HBase Foundation

##### This HBase training course provides a comprehensive hands-on introduction to HBase, from configuration to operation. HBase architecture and design principles are covered in depth, including best practices for optimal scale out and performance. Attendees will learn how to administer the HBase system and perform routine tasks through the HBase shell and will build a complete HBase cluster over the course of several labs. 

##### The Java software development API is also covered at a level of detail appropriate for the participants. Students will leave the course ready to begin working with HBase immediately and will be prepared to make decisions as to when HBase may be an appropriate solution and when it may not.

##### This is an Instructor-Led-Training (ILT) training class and is available for in-person and virtual delivery.
