## Cryptography in Cloud Native Systems

This in-depth hands-on course introduces developers, security professionals and other technology staff to the principles and practices driving modern cryptography. Day one begins with a cryptography overview and coverage of both block and stream ciphers. Block cipher modes for streaming systems are covered along with schemes for encryption at rest on prem and in the cloud.

Day two ties in hashing and signing technologies along with keys and key exchange. On the practical side, day two introduces attendees to certificates, PKI, TLS, IPSEC, WPA2 and various MAC and digital signature schemes used to authenticate binaries and containers. Each module in the course includes a hands-on lab, giving attendees a chance to work with common tools and technologies, providing practical insight to accompany the theory.

Day three introduces various key management schemes and tools such as Hashi Corp Vault and common cloud native platform solutions. The final modules cover authentication and encryption platforms such as Kerberos and SSH, with a deeper look at GSSAPI and other supporting technologies.

This is an instructor-led training (ILT) class and is available for onsite and online delivery.
