## HTTP/2 Foundation

This intensive two day hands on course is designed to provide working developers, IT staff and other technology professionals with a comprehensive introduction to the HTTP/2 standard. Each of the eight modules in this course includes a hands on lab designed to give attendees a detailed understanding of the operation of HTTP/2 through the construction of simple HTTP/2 programs and Wire Shark packet inspection. The course begins with a review of HTTP 1.1 and the challenges it faces. The course then walks through all of the key features of HTTP/2 and explains how they improve on the shortfall present in HTTP 1.1. Performance comparisons, tools and the state of HTTP/2 in the wild are all covered in detail. Upon completion of the course attendees will have the skills and information necessary to begin designing and working with HTTP/2 based software, systems and tool.

This is an instructor-led training (ILT) class and is available for onsite and online delivery.
