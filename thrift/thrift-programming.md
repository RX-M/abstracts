##### This training course provides in-depth coverage of the Apache Thrift serialization and RPC platform for polyglot programming. Attendees will learn how to create collaborative RPC servers and client using Apache Thrift in several languages. Lecture and labs will teach students how to isolate applications from the underlying physical end points in serialization and communications scenarios using Apache Thrift transports. 

##### Transport layering, framing and buffering will be covered in detail along with I/O to memory, disk and networks. The course examines the Apache Thrift plug-in serialization framework, covering binary, compact and JSON protocols as well as serialization techniques for persistent cross language data storage.
