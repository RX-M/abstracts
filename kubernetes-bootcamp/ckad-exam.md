The Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) program has been developed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), in collaboration with The Linux Foundation, to help expand the Kubernetes ecosystem through standardized training and certification. As one of the highest velocity projects in the history of open source, Kubernetes use is exploding.

The proctored online exam, administered by the Linux Foundation, consists of a set of performance-based items (problems) to be solved in a command line; candidates have 2 hours to complete the tasks. The Certification focuses on the skills required to demonstrate that users can design, build, configure, and expose cloud native applications for Kubernetes and their weights on the exam are:

- Core Concepts 13%
- Configuration 18%
- Multi-Container Pods 10%
- Observability 18%
- Pod Design 20%
- Services & Networking 13%
- State Persistence 8%
