## Puppet Development

RX-M's Puppet Development training combines the subject matter from our Puppet Administration & Intermediate Puppet courses to provide your organization with an extensive five-day treatment on Puppet OSS. This course covers a comprehensive set of skills required by system administrators and developers who are implementing, administering or authoring content for Puppet IT Automation software in complex environments. The class brings together the infrastructure and DevOps facets of configuration management, giving equal time to deployment/configuration and coding Puppet modules. By the completion of the course, attendees will feel confident coding, configuring, customizing and optimizing a Puppet solution for large scale deployments.

This is an instructor-led training (ILT) class and is available for onsite and online delivery.
