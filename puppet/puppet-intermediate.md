## Intermediate Puppet 

(2 days) This training course picks up where RX-M's Puppet Administration class leaves off and teaches students a best practice approach to leveraging advanced aspects of Puppet software. Lecture and hands-on labs collaborate to teach students the Hiera data store, the PuppetDB warehouse, and the Marionette Collective (MCollective) framework for building server orchestration or parallel job-execution systems. The Puppet Dashboard and the Foreman open source web interfaces are compared and contrasted and attendees will also learn how to use Ruby to extend Puppet. By the completion of the course, attendees will feel confident deploying a sophisticated Puppet solution for large-scale deployments.
