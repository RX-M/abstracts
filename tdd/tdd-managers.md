## Test Driven Development for Managers

This course is designed to provide business and technical management with a comprehensive overview of Test Driven Development. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of the principles and practices and tools associated with TDD and gain a concrete understanding of the TDD process through demonstrations using Java and common testing tools, such as JUnit, Cucumber and Jenkins.

The course considers not only the benefits but also the shortcomings and pitfalls associated with driving development with tests and testing, helping managers to identify the right approach and the right goals for their own teams. Throughout, the course includes pragmatic advice targeted at maximizing the value-add of a test driven program, with perspectives ranging from the foundational views of Beck and XP to the more moderate approaches of Coplien and others.

Upon completion, managers and other stakeholders will learn and have a well-balanced and firmly grounded understanding of TDD and how it can help organizations produce higher quality at a lower cost.

This is an Instructor-Led-Training (ILT) training class and is available for in-person and virtual delivery.
