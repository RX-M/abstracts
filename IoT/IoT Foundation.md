##Internet of Things (IoT)

This course introduces engineers and technical staff to the Internet of Things (IoT) through a combination of theory and practical applications. This three-day intensive training class is hands-on, giving students a chance to explore various aspects of IoT technology. The course begins with an orientation to the IoT space and the most important technologies in play. The course progresses through foundational concepts such as microcontrollers, radios, networks and sensors with a range of discussion and experiments to deepen understanding. The course then moves to the cloud to examine a range of backend and distribution/gateway technologies. The open source LIoTA platform is examined as a case study and in hands-on lab work. Upon course completion attendees will have a broad, yet practical understanding of IoT and the IoT space.
