## Practical Machine Learning with Python

Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence wherein computer programs learn new capabilities when exposed to data. This 3 day instructor led training course teaches the basics of machine learning with practical hands on labs using Python and various support libraries.

Day one introduces the foundational concepts of data science and machine learning. Hands on labs progressively build a basic collection of tools and experiments reinforcing the concepts covered in lecture. Attendees will learn how to create a basic Python development environment for machine learning while producing several basic but useful and instructive programs. Basic probability, statistics and basic data curation skills are developed throughout.

Days two and three build on the foundational skills imparted in day one, introducing formal classification of the most common machine learning algorithms and their purposes. Modules and labs give attendees experience using the most common algorithms and a chance to create real solutions, such as fraud detection and recommendation engines.

Upon completion attendees will have a broad but practical understanding of machine learning and a base from which to pursue real applications and further study.

This is an instructor-led training (ILT) class and is available for onsite and online delivery.
