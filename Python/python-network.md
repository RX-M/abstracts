## Python for Network Engineers

This intensive four-day hands-on Python training course is designed to help network engineers unlock the power of Python in combination with the programmability of modern networking systems. The class provides a start to finish introduction to Python application programming for networking and network equipment. Students will learn about Python data types, program structure, functions, classes and methods; will work with Git and understand distributed code management techniques; and will learn and use Python networking packages such as paramiko, netmiko pysnmp and more.

Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of Python networking features and how to code with a wide range of third party and vendor specific libraries for controlling networking and network equipment. Students will gain hands-on experience with Python and network systems applications; will work with Cisco IOS, VMware NSX and Arista EOS; and will learn how to use Ansible to automate network configurations.

Upon completion of the training, attendees will have the skills and information necessary to begin developing purpose-built Python applications to integrate with and control networking systems in an enterprise setting.

This is an Instructor-Led-Training (ILT) training class and is available for in-person and virtual delivery.
