##Microservice Application Architecture

This course is designed to provide engineering staff with a comprehensive overview of the microservice architecture pattern for software development.

Overview

This intensive two day hands on course is designed to provide working developers, devops staff and other technology professionals with a comprehensive introduction to the microservice architecture pattern. Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of microservices and their unique benefits, as well as their drawbacks and how to avoid same. Students will gain hands on experience working with microservices in several programming languages (Go, Python and NodeJS). The course covers the benefits of container based microservice packaging as well as dynamic application management. Attendees will examine various use cases and architecture patterns for microservice based applications throughout the course, with focused discussion on microservice communications, transactions and state management. Upon completion of the course attendees will have the skills and information necessary to begin designing and working with microservice based applications in a fashion commensurate with industry best practices.

Prerequisites

Because the course focuses on microservice properties and design no particular programming language expertise is required though attendees should have experience with at least one programming language. Each attendee will require the ability to run a 64 bit virtual machine (provided with the course).
