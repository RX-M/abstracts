## Cucumber Fundamentals

##### This training course is designed to introduce programmers and testers to Behavior Driven Development and Cucumber. Attendees are introduced to BDD concepts and how Cucumber facilitates such development practices, combining Domain Driven Design with Test Driven Development. The course covers general Cucumber philosophy and features but tailors practical examples and labs to the Ruby and Rails development environments.
##### Participants will become familiar with crafting executable specifications in the form of Cucumber features and step driven tests. Hands-on labs take students through the process of building requirement-driven test suites for new and existing applications using a range of features including data tables and databases. Labs also give participants practical experience installing and configuring Cucumber.

##### This is an Instructor-Led-Training (ILT) training class and is available for in-person and virtual delivery.
