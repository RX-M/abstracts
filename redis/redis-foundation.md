## Redis Foundation

##### This training course provides experienced development, DevOps and operations staff with a comprehensive introduction to the Redis advanced Key/Value cache and store platform. Redis architecture and operations as well as data structure server features are examined in detail including a comprehensive examination of the various Redis data types. Because examples and labs make use of Python, Ruby and JavaScript, it is helpful if students are familiar with at least one of these.

##### Each student will setup and configure their own Redis instance for testing and example Redis clients are constructed in class and lab sessions using several languages, demonstrating a wide range of Redis commands and best practices. Optimal memory use is discussed in the context of key eviction schemes and distribution; transactions, replication and high availability models are examined along with Redis security features. The course also introduces the Redis Lua scripting interpreter and demonstrates it use and benefits.  Attendees will learn Redis at a foundational level.

##### This is an Instructor-Led-Training (ILT) training class and is available for in-person and virtual delivery.
