## Internet of Things (IoT) Introduction

This two day training class introduces engineers and technical staff to the Internet of Things (IoT) through a combination of theory and practical applications. The course is hands-on, giving students a chance to explore various aspects of IoT technology. The course begins with an orientation to the IoT space and the most important technologies in play. The course progresses through foundational concepts such as microcontrollers, radios, networks and sensors with a range of discussion and experiments to deepen understanding. The course wraps up with a discussion of IoT backend systems and, in particular, the various cloud based systems purposed specifically for the IoT market. Upon course completion attendees will have a broad, yet practical understanding of IoT and the IoT space.  This course can be combined with the IoT intermediate training class for a five day intensive training event. 

This is an instructor-led training (ILT) class and is available for onsite and online delivery.
