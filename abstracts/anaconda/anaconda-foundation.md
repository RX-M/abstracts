## Anaconda Foundation

This hands-on course provides Python developers with a broad introduction to the open source Anaconda platform. The core Anaconda tools are covered in detail helping attendees master multiple environments and projects, become familiar with the conda package management system and gain experience adding, removing and updating packages and environments.

Training also provides attendees with an introduction to some of the most popular and useful libraries in the Anaconda toolkit, including scientific computing standards: NumPy, SciPy, pandas, and Jupyter. Upon completion, programmers will be prepared to begin immediately taking advantage of Anaconda and its vast ecosystem of tools and libraries.

This is an instructor-led training (ILT) class and is available for onsite and online delivery.
