## Docker + Kubernetes for Operators

This four day hands-on course is designed to provide Kubernetes platform operators with a detailed look at the administration and deployment of the Docker and Kubernetes platforms through a combination of lecture, demonstrations, and extensive lab work. The architecture of Docker is examined at the runC, containerd and Docker daemon levels, with examinations of cgroups, namespaces, container and image filesystems, and Docker's operating directory. The course also covers the core Kubernetes control plane components in detail, including: etcd, API Server, Scheduler, and Controller Manager, as well as the worker node agents: Kubelet and Kube-proxy. Skills developed include Kubernetes installation and operation, pod operations, manifest construction, state and security operations, networking, debugging, maintenance, backup and restore, as well as best practices.
