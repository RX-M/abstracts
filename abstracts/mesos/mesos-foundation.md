## Mesos Foundation

This intensive two-day hands-on Mesos training course is designed to provide working developers, DevOps staff, sys admins and other technology professionals with a comprehensive introduction to Apache Mesos. During the course, attendees will build and deploy a complete Apache Mesos-based Data Center Operating System (DC/OS) running Apache Mesos, Marathon, Mesos DNS, Chronos, and Docker.

Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of Apache Mesos, its place in the market and how Apache Mesos integrates with higher-level systems like Kubernetes, Spark, and Hadoop, as well as lower-level systems like OpenStack and AWS. Upon completion of the course, attendees will have the skills and information necessary to begin working with Apache Mesos in their own environment.

This is an instructor-led training (ILT) class and is available for onsite and online delivery.
