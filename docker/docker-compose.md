## Docker Compose

This course is designed to provide existing users of Docker with a comprehensive look at Docker Compose and container configuration possibilities made available by Compose. Students are introduced to Compose and its purpose; will be exposed to the entire Compose DSL; will have the chance to install Compose and define and build basic Compose applications. This course examines the strengths and weaknesses of Compose when used in a production setting, including its integration with Docker Swarm and its use of the new Distributed Application Bundle (DAB) image format.

Upon completion of this compact, intensive hands-on course, students will have an in-depth understanding of Compose and its use cases, as well as the ability to immediately use Compose in development and testing applications.

This is an instructor-led training (ILT) class and is available for onsite and online delivery.
